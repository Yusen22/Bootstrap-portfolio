# Bootstrap-Portfolio


## Description

This project uses HTML and the Bootstrap v4.1 framework to create an online portfolio for myself as a front-end developer, displaying completed work, general information, skills and contact details. The nav-bar in the top-right corner of the screen at wider pixel-widths can be used to navigate to the related section.

The portfolio also features a 'jumbotron' image in the header, and a section that allows users to sign-up to email updates. There is also a footer which provides icon links and copyright information.

As this is an ongoing project, some of the links in the 'Work' section are currently placeholders with the 'Folding Cards', 'Pre-work Study Guide' and 'Search Engine Optimisation' having working links.

## Usage

To locate a section of information on the portfolio webpage, click on the links to right of the top nav-bar. The nav-bar can be returned to from the footer of the page by using the appropriate link. 

Hovering over a card in the 'Work' section will make it more visible to the user, and provide a link to the Github Pages link of the relevant project.

Press CTRL + SHFT + I (Windows) or CMD + SHFT + I (Mac OS) to open the Chrome DevTools window and view accessibility improvements in HTML and CSS. Locate the 'Inspect' button in the top-left of the Chrome DevTools window, and hover over images on the webpage to view their alt-text. Hovering over different content on the webpage will also provide information on which semantic HTML element the content belongs to in the Chrome DevTool window.
